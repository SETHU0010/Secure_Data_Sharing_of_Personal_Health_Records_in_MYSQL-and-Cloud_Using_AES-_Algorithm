# Secure Data Sharing of Personal Health Records in MySQL and Cloud Using AES Algorithm 🔒☁️

## Abstract 📝
This project focuses on ensuring high security and authentication for data stored on cloud platforms using cryptographic algorithms and the BYOEK platform. The model's safety is evaluated based on execution time and data trading efficiency.

## Objectives 🎯
- Implement cryptographic algorithms for secure cloud data storage.
- Evaluate and verify the BYOEK model's safety.
- Compare execution time and data trading efficiency.

## Scope 🌐
- Provide a secure auditing method for storing data on the cloud securely.

## Problem Statement ❗
Managing access control of encrypted data in cloud computing is challenging, especially when data is outsourced to untrusted third-party servers.

## Existing System 🔄
- Cloud auditing protocol for securely transferring medical data.
- Uses privacy-preserving transformation and homomorphic transform techniques.

## Proposed System 🚀
- Cryptographic algorithms on the BYOEK platform.
- Safety evaluated through execution time and data trading comparisons.
